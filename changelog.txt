** Aperio Recovery Tool v4.0 **

-= Change Log =-
V4.2.5	22/02/2020

Found bug in ubuntu.cfg file, caused Ubuntu not to launch (extra \). Removed.

Created directory "livesvr" in root to overcome the clonezilla initamfs rsync issue when using the "toram" feature.

V4.2.4	29/01/2020

Set sdb3 to sdb2 for "backup" images.

(Todo) Improve "toram" execution. Currently created false "/live" folder to trick system to boot up due to inability for clonezilla to create nested directories via "mkdir" command in tmpfs. Proposed solution:
	- in boot parameter, set "live-media-path=live" as the additional nested directory will be truncated in tmpfs (eg. clonezilla/live will appear as /live in tmpfs (/run/live/medium/).
	- in boot parameter, set "toram" as "toram=clonezillasvr/live,clonezillasvr/utils,clonezillasvr/EFI,clonezillasvr/syslinux,clonezillasvr/boot,clonezillasvr/home,clonezillasvr/.disk,clonezilla/scripts" to include all base codes for full function support.

(Todo) Create backup ISO of thumbdrive to be able to regenerate via Windows-based "Rufus" program.

(TODO) Add script to run aperio card flashing via Aperio Box linux script (plant default startup script into fedora and run after reboot) - very chim

(TODO) Clonezilla BITTORRENT/SERVER - Clonezilla Server re-numbering system to number Aperio box according to (1) Actual Tester Number ;) (2) FIFO - First AperioBox completed clone = N0. 1, 2nd Ap box completed clone = No.2, and so on...

V4.2.3   27/07/2019

Create 'UsbFsck' program to check Aperio USB status for (1)Dirty flag (2)"has_journal" flag (3)"journal_data_writeback".
	If (1) flag exists, sudo e2fsck -p[auto fix]f[orce] /dev/sdb1-3 (2) exist, run "tune2fs -O ^has_journal" (3) exists run "tune2fs -o journal_data_writeback"

(TODO) Add script to run aperio card flashing via Aperio Box linux script (plant default startup script into fedora and run after reboot) - very chim

(TODO) Clonezilla BITTORRENT/SERVER - Clonezilla Server re-numbering system to number Aperio box according to (1) Actual Tester Number ;) (2) FIFO - First AperioBox completed clone = N0. 1, 2nd Ap box completed clone = No.2, and so on...

V4.2.2   18/07/2019

Replaced corrupted Portwell v8.01 image with a working copy.

Clonezilla server to mount RAM DISK to unload Good Aperio HDD image to RAMDISK. This is to enable the Thumbdrive
to be used to reboot the clients into PXE (network boot) to connect to server. Thus avoiding multiple Thumbdrives.

Added Clonezilla BITTORRENT/Server 'ocs-live-feed-img' option --no-of-clients as "ask_user".
This will prompt user to input no of users to clone. This will enable server to accurately start cloning service once correct number 
of clients connected. If exceeded 30 minutes (due to incorrect number of clients or human error) server will still continue to run
after 30 minutes (not applicable for BITTORRENT SERVER).

Clonezilla BITTORRENT SERVER - Added warning to user to ensure HOST APERIO BOX HDD (the box in use) has a good running hdd. Else bad image will be populated.
If Host Aperio HDD is not a good running one, user has to press NO to abort and follow the warning instructions.

Added PXE Boot menu in Syslinux menu to expedite Server client boot into network

Update clonezilla core to clonezilla-live-2.6.1-25-i686-pae

Bug found in clonezilla server: Backup Clonerestore mode := mounted image partition only.
Hence, pre/postrun script unable to attach to clonezilla main folder. Client will hang at startup as a result
Solution: Mount seperately for image(home/partimag) and for clonezilla main folder (to attach scripts).

(TODO) Add script to run aperio card flashing via Aperio Box linux script (plant default startup script into fedora and run after reboot) - very chim

(reverted - not working) Clonezilla BITTORRENT/SERVER - changed -dm(dhcpd mode) from "auto-detect" to "start-new-dhcpd" to enable unknown Aperio box # to be numbered based on FIFO(1st cloned=1 2nd cloned=2...so on)

V4.2.1   26/11/2018
Added -fsck-src-part-y in backup menu to avoid "Source disk full issue".


V4.2    26/11/2018
Upgraded extlinux to ver 5.0++

Added partition /dev/sdb3 (approx size 7gb on 32GB usb - 1 img roughly 3.5GB) Labelled: images .. This partition is used for CloneRestore operations so that existing contents in sdb1 is not corrupted

Added these steps using Fdisk (linux) to enable USB boot from old and new bios:
    #erase mbr
    echo Erase mbr
    dd if=/dev/zero of=$flash bs=1024 count=1024 -- $flash is device (eg. /dev/sdb , /dev/sdc)
    
    #create partition table and partition 
echo Create partition table
# for usb to boot in old or new bios, must ensure cylinders head=255 sectors=63 
# bytes=512 and IMPT : BEGINNING OF PARTITION=63
fdisk -b 512 -C $cylinders -H 255 -S 63 $flash <<EEOF

Added these commands as part of USB prep to improve reliability and speed of flash drive:
    # create ext4 filesystem without journal
     mkfs.ext4 -O ^has_journal $part  -- $part is device (eg. /dev/sdb1 , /dev/sdc1)

    # give your newly formatted partition a name
     e2label $part AperioFlash63

    # Use data mode for filesystem as writeback for better performance
     tune2fs -o journal_data_writeback $part

    # Delete has_journal option
    tune2fs -O ^has_journal $part

    # Require FSCK after 10 mounts on first partition
    tune2fs -c 10 /dev/sdb1
    
    Required fsck. 
    ==============
    e2fsck -f /dev/sdb1 
    e2fsck -f /dev/sdb2 

    # Write to disc any cache data
    sync

    # partprobe informs OS of partition changes
    partprobe -s $part

v4.1	27/02/2018
added command HWCLOCK --systohw to RunFsck script to sync hardware clock to system clock. this is to ensure fsck run properly.

removed -t (Clients dont copy mbr from image) in Clonezillasvr.cfg to avoid boot error on newly cloned hdd in clients during server mode.

Tuned auto-detect-network script to detect, init and run dhclient -v on the network device in ocs-live-feed-img script.

During copy-restore mode, will rum fsck and clean aperio hdd before copying automatically

v4	04/01/2018
(Experimental)Added liteserver feature to enable server based mass cloning of any image based from Clonezilla live-feed-img feature
	- for liteserver to work must follow directory structure (clonezilla\live--as lite server only recognise \live as folder and not \live-svr) and add \live to root (STRANGE ~but TRUE)
	- version used for lite server : clonezilla-live-2.5.4-5-i686-pae
	- for this version, seperated in folder: clonezillasvr

(Experimental)Added pre and post script run to normal clonezilla RESTORE feature to automate cellnumber.txt numbering to ori tester number. (success)

(Experimental)Added pre and post script run to normal clonezilla CloneRestore feature to automate cellnumber.txt numbering to -88 when cloning and back to tester number after~clone completed (success)
	- Autonumber will follow these guidelines when activated:
		1) Use last 2 or 3 gigit of current IP address in use of Aperio Box
		2) Use '88' if no IP address available (due to no network or no dhcp server online)

For Advantech based RESTORE will use clonezilla ver : clonezilla-live-2.5.4-5-i686-pae (same as clonezilla lite server)
(deferred - not implemented) For Portwell based RESTORE OR CloneRestore will user clonezilla ver : clonezilla-live-20170905-zesty-i386

Folders for different clonezilla versions partitioned is the following folders:
		- original version (clonezilla-live-2.3.2-22-i686-pae) in clonezilla\live
		- (deferred - not implemented) i386 based version to cater for slow Portwell systems (clonezilla-live-20170905-zesty-i386) in clonezilla\live-i386
		- latest version (includes lite-server) (clonezilla-live-2.5.4-5-i686-pae) in clonezillasvr\live

Original (old) clonezilla menu moved to clonezilla\clonezillaoldver.cfg with link from main menu

Added logging function. Will be save in /Logs folder in USb AND /home/aperio in HDD. Logs saved will be clonezilla.log,daemon.log,partclone.log and AperioUSBLog.log.

v3.2	01/12/2017
Added "-o noatime,nodiratime" to speedup mount performance by negating updating of "access time to file and/or directory changes
Added "rm -rvf /home/partimag/" to clonerestore to delete existing image to reduce storage space used
